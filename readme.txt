Overwrites Wordpress defined javaScript to nullify impact of multiple changes during the release cycle.

== Description ==

The plugin gives you control of the JavaScript files that are loaded on both your THEMES and the WordPress ADMIN area.
This is especially helpful for development and testing, but really comes into it's own when WordPress is going through a release cycle and jQuery versions can change between alpha/beta/RC releases without warning. 




== Installation ==

1. Upload `kevinjohn_gallagher__javascript_control.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
